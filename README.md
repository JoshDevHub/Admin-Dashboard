# Admin Dashboard

A project to build a dashboard design using CSS grid concepts.

## Mockup

Here is the design I was following for this page: ![Design File](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/html_css/grid-lessons/project-dashboard/dashboard-project.png)

The user avatars are different because I did not have access to the assets used in the mockup.

## Things I Learned

This is the first page I've built where I made extensive use of CSS grid. Many of the containers are organized with grid, though there's still some flexbox sprinkled in.

This is also the first page where I've worked with SVGs -- all of the non-avatar icons on the page are SVGs.
